# Course_Project (drafted)

## 1) Description
In place of a final exam, CISC7201 students will have the opportunity to showcase their skills through a tutorial project that guides users through a data science pipeline. This project will encompass essential tasks such as 1) data collection; 2) data curation, parsing, and management; 3) exploratory data analysis; 4) hypothesis testing and machine learning for analysis (if any); and 5) culminate in the creation of a curated message or messages summarizing the insights gained during the tutorial. Please note that you are not required to include all of these components in order to receive a full grade. 

Students will have the freedom to select **an application area and dataset(s)** that align with their interests, enabling them to explore their creativity. To gather ideas and discover potential data sources, students can refer to lecture slides, explore platforms like Medium or Zhihu, or engage in discussions with the teaching team for guidance. The tutorial should be self-contained, combining **Markdown prose and Python code within a Jupyter Notebook**, and must be delivered as **a Gitea Repository**, ensuring a comprehensive and interactive learning experience.

This tutorial project will provide students with a valuable opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills in a practical and meaningful way, further enhancing their understanding of the data science process.

Some example tutorials are listed for your reference.
1. Predicting a win in Rainbow Six: https://jiglesia3.github.io/
2. Predict the outcome of League of Legends Games: https://github.com/DavidMatthewFraser/Predict_LeagueOfLegends_Games
3. Bitcoin Prediction: https://github.com/manthanthakker/BitcoinPrediction
4. Analysis of crime data in College Park: https://andresgogo.github.io/

As a general guideline, the tutorial (in **the jupyter notebook**) should include a minimum of 1000 words of descriptive prose and at least 100 lines of well-written and legitimate Python code (by yourself). Additionally, it is important to provide adequate documentation, meaningful visualizations, and relevant links to external resources that can assist the reader in understanding and exploring the topic further. This ensures that the tutorial is comprehensive, informative, and user-friendly.

### 1.1) Gitea system
For each student account, you need to do the following:
1. Create a git repository titled "courseproject_%studentid%" on Gitea under the organization "2023_CISC7201", e.g., courseproject_mc12345; 
2. Update the markdown file README.md for the basic introduction of your project;
3. Upload your jupyter notebook into the repositor.
4. Please also provide sufficient information for TA to run your program in the README.md file, e.g., providing the download link (OneDrive link or any other) of the dataset and the corresponding instruction. 

In this project, I hope you learn how to commit and clone project from git like system via the command line.

## 2) Marking

We will evaluate the tutorial based on the following four dimensions, assigning a numeric score between 1 and 10 for each:

1. Motivation (20%): Does the tutorial effectively convey the relevance and importance of the topic, both in general and specifically in the context of data science?
2. Understanding (20%): After reading the tutorial, does an uninformed reader feel well-informed about the topic? Does it provide new insights for readers who are already familiar with the subject matter?
3. Code (40%): Is the code well-written, well-documented, and easily reproducible? Does it contribute to the reader's comprehension of the tutorial? Does it provide practical examples that highlight specific techniques?
4. Subjective evaluation (20%): Is the conclusion sound? Is the tutorial attractive? Any new finding?

**Notes**
1. Please be aware that we do not accept any cloned or similar submissions from online sources. If we find that your project closely resembles existing content from the internet, it will result in a failed grade. 
2. It is important to note that the marks you receive are based on your individual contributions to the project, rather than solely relying on advanced solutions sourced from others. For example, using a library to fine-tune a pre-existing LLM model on a publicly available dataset may not receive a high grade, even if the topic itself is innovative or emerging. We value originality, creativity, and your personal input in the tutorial project.
